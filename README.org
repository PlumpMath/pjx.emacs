* Emacs-projtools 

IDEA: Create an Emacs package to handle software projects. 

Wishlist / Requirements:

 - File template selection per lanaguage
 - Project template selection 
 - Project metadata search
 - Integrate to build system
 - Provide higher order functions
 - Close and Open a set of files

Features: 

 - switch between project buffers

 - switch between project dired buffers

 - switch between project buffers associated to files

 - find files in project sub-directories

 - find files in project sub-directories matching a regex

 - close all project files

 - open a project in a new frame dedicated to the project. The
   commands C-x right (M-x next-buffer) and C-x left (M-x
   previous-buffer) switches only between project buffer files.

 - Run compilation commands and make specific commands at project root
   directory.
